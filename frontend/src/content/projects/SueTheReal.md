I worked as a **Web Designer** on the development of the promotional landing page for the game **“Hit It Back”**, created for the Afro-Brazilian game studio **Sue The Real**.

I used **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to build a modern, responsive, and accessible interface. I implemented a **newsletter subscription form** integrated with a **WordPress (PHP/MySQL) backend**, applying security best practices to prevent **XSS vulnerabilities**. I prioritized **accessibility standards** and executed **SEO optimizations**, achieving **Lighthouse scores above 90** in these areas.
