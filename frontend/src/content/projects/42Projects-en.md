Personal and academic repository showcasing the **projects developed during the Common Core at 42 São Paulo**, a **tuition-free, project-based programming school**, between **September 2022 and January 2024**.

- Participation in a **fully project-driven learning model**, focused on **hands-on problem solving**, peer evaluation, and self-directed study.
- Development of multiple projects using **C** and **Shell**, following strict rules, limited standard libraries, and **Unix-based environments**.
- Strong emphasis on **low-level programming**, **memory management**, **process control**, and **system-level concepts**.
- Continuous practice of **code quality**, **performance**, and **norm compliance** according to 42’s standards.

# Core Projects

- **Libft**: Creation of a personal **static C library**, reimplementing standard functions and deepening understanding of **memory allocation**, **strings**, and **Makefiles**.
- **Get Next Line**: Implementation of a function to read from a **file descriptor line by line**, focusing on **file I/O** and **static variables**.
- **Ft_printf**: Development of a custom version of **printf**, exploring **format specifiers**, **variadic arguments**, and output formatting.
- **Born2BeRoot**: Configuration and hardening of a **Linux virtual machine**, covering **system administration**, users, permissions, and services.
- **So_long**: Design and implementation of a simple **2D game**, applying concepts of **graphics rendering**, **game loops**, and user interaction.
- **Pipex**: Recreation of **Unix pipelines**, working with **process management**, **fork**, **exec**, and **interprocess communication**.

- **Version control** using **Git**, with projects organized in a modular and documented structure.
- Repository maintained as a **long-term learning archive**, reflecting growth in **software engineering fundamentals** and **problem-solving skills**.
