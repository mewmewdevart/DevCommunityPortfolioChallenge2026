Personal project focused on **hands-on Front-End learning**, using **HTML** and **CSS** to create **visual illustrations and scenes (CSS Art)**, developed in an experimental and continuous way.

- **Creation of illustrations and scenes entirely with HTML and CSS**, without using images or JavaScript.
- Exploration of core concepts such as **layout**, **positioning**, **shapes**, **colors**, and **CSS animations**.
- Practice of **code organization**, style reuse, and **semantic HTML structure**.
- Project used as a **learning lab**, reinforcing essential **Front-End Web Development fundamentals**.
- **Version control with Git** and continuous deployment via **GitHub Pages**.
- Open-source repository focused on **learning, experimentation, and creativity**, exploring CSS as an artistic medium.
